## About

The python script **apifunc** maps Dockerfile variables, instructions, and functions, a Python script that analyzes a Dockerfile and extracts relevant information.

### Parsing Dockerfile Instructions

- The Dockerfile is looking for docker instructions such `FROM`, `RUN`, `ADD`, `ENV`, `ENTRYPOINT`, and `CMD`  line by line
- For each instruction, is extracting the relevant details (e.g., base image, commands, environment variables)

### Mapping Variables and Functions

- That mapping associates each instruction with its corresponding variables and functions.
- For example:
 - `FROM` instruction maps to the base image.
 - `RUN` instruction maps to the commands executed during image build.
 - `ENV` instruction maps to environment variables.
 - `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` instructions map to the entry points for running the container.


### Usage

- Replace `"path/to/your/Dockerfile"` with the actual path to your Dockerfile.
- Run the script using `python apifunc.py`.
- It will print out the relevant details for each instruction found in the Dockerfile.

Remember that this script is a starting point, and you can enhance it further based on your specific needs. 
Additionally, consider using existing Dockerfile parsing libraries (e.g., `apifunc`) for more robust solutions.


### Run local as command line

```bash
apifunc build
```

run service local

```bash
apifunc run
```

### Run remote as command line


```bash
apifunc run remote ssh://
```





### Run as a Service

Serve as a service docker swarm, kubernetes, podman, ...
in nginx, caddy, express, 


```bash
apifunc run nginx
```

```bash
apifunc --file Dockerfile run nginx --config nginx.conf
```

run service local

```bash
apifunc serve remote ssh://
```

### Run by Hypervisor

Serve as a virtual service docker swarm, kubernetes, podman, ...

```bash
apifunc run kube
```


```bash
apifunc run docker
```



```bash
apifunc run swarm
```


### Development


```bash
apifunc 
```


```bash
apifunc init
```


```bash
apifunc test
```



```bash
apifunc publish
```

Designing the Object Detection Application
Now that we have our environment set up, let's dive into the process of designing our object detection application. We will be using the Haar cascade classifier, a popular method for object detection.

Step 1: Importing the Required Libraries
Start by importing the necessary libraries:
```python 
import cv2 
```

Step 2: Loading the Pre-trained Model
Next, load the pre-trained model using the cv2.CascadeClassifier class:
```python 
cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('path_to_cascade.xml') 
```

Step 3: Reading and Preprocessing the Image
Read the image and convert it to grayscale:
```python
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg') gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) 
```

Step 4: Detecting Objects
Now, detect the objects in the image using the detectMultiScale method:

```python
objects = cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30)) 
```

Step 5: Drawing Rectangles around Detected Objects
Finally, iterate over the detected objects and draw rectangles around them:

```python
for (x, y, w, h) in objects: cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2) 
```
